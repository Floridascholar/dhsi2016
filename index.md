## Theme: "From This to That"

Throughout the week, we will survey physical computing and digital fabrication techniques by modelling, fabricating, programming, and repurposing objects as both bits and atoms. This process of converting objects from this material into that material will most obviously involve negotiations between screen media and tactile media but also between form and composition, metaphor and matter, code and affordance, surface and depth. Instead of reducing such work to a digital-analog, electronic-print, or new-old binaries, we will approach them as entanglements of materials and cultures, where composing and thinking with media is often quite messy and rife with contingencies. 

By the end of the week, you should: 

* Learn some basics of physical computing, 3D modelling, and fabrication. 
* Identify common components of physical computing and fabrication projects. 
* Prototype a simple project and communicate the aims of your prototype to others in the course. 
* Know how to share components of your prototype online. 
* Become familiar with how physical computing and fabrication operate at the intersection of the arts, humanities, and culture.  

## Definitions 

Physical computing "means building interactive physical systems by the use of software and hardware that can sense and respond to the analog world. While this definition is broad enough to encompass things such as smart automotive traffic control systems or factory automation processes, it is not commonly used to describe them. In the broad sense, physical computing is a creative framework for understanding human beings' relationship to the digital world. In practical use, the term most often describes handmade art, design or DIY hobby projects that use sensors and microcontrollers to translate analog input to a software system, and/or control electro-mechanical devices such as motors, servos, lighting or other hardware." More care of [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_computing). 

Digital modelling and fabrication involve "a process that joins design with the construction / production through the use of 3-D modelling software and additive and subtractive manufacturing processes. These tools allow designers to produce material digitally, which is something greater than an image on screen, and actually tests the accuracy of the software and computer lines." More care of [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_modeling_and_fabrication). 

## Software 

Before or during the course, it would be great if you could install and/or experiment with the following software on your own machine: 

* [Arduino Integrated Design Environment](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* [Agisoft PhotoScan](http://www.agisoft.com/)
* [123D Make](http://www.123dapp.com/make)
* [123D Design](http://www.123dapp.com/design)
* [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/)
* [CorelDRAW](http://www.coreldraw.com/)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

In some cases (e.g., CorelDRAW and PhotoScan), you may want to consider trial licenses. Also, feel free to start an account with [GitHub](https://github.com/), if you don't already have one. 

## Hardware

To the course, you should bring your own laptop, if possible. We will bring the following for you to use: 

* Arduinos 
* Raspberry Pis
* Fabricated components 
* Sensors, actuators, wires, motors, batteries, and breadboards 
* Glue, scissors, calipers, and various crafting and design supplies 
* SLR cameras 

We (the instructors) also have access to CNC equipment for digital fabrication on the UVic campus. The four of us will be using this equipment to cut, mill, engrave, and design components before and during DHSI. You do not need to provide your own components. 

## Reading

For your reference, we've compiled some publications corresponding with the course activities, workshops, and discussions. We obviously don't expect you to read them in advance, but they may be informative during the week and after. Your call. Where possible, they are available online in PDF (link forthcoming) and via your DHSI CoursePak. They are also listed below, with URLs, divided into "core" and "related" reading.

## Favourite Projects

Throughout the week, we'll share our favourite physical computing and fabrication projects, including projects that inspired many of our experiments. As you'll likely notice, they represent an array of disciplines, including design, literary studies, sculpture, sound art, history, media studies, cultural studies, and engineering.

## Some Suggestions for Prototyping 

Below are some practical suggestions for prototyping projects involving physical computing and fabrication. These are clearly biased. Feel free to take them or leave them. 

### Before You Start Prototyping 

* Conduct an environmental scan. Is code already out there? Does a similar project already exist? Could you repurpose or edit existing models and builds? Or can you find schematics for the parts you are planning to use?
* Create a bill of materials that accounts for what the materials mean or connote. For instance, is plastic the best choice? 
* In terms of vendors, http://www.digikey.com/ and https://www.adafruit.com/ are popular options. 
* Read reviews of any technologies before you purchase them. Ask others if they've used the technologies, too. Approach publications such as *Make* with some skepticism, or read against the grain of enthusiasm and hype. 

### As You Prototype 

* Consider working first with paper or modeling clay. This approach can save you both time and materials. 
* Circulate your prototype for feedback from friends. Have them interact with what you are making and document the interactions. Consider designs in the context of use. 
* Whenever possible, write about the prototyping process as you go. Reflect on it, too. Think about prototyping as inquiry (not a means to an end), where a prototype is a situation for interpretation or negotiation (not a product).
* Don't hesitate to post questions or challenges you have with your code or circuit design on relevant forums online. Or read existing threads for similar projects to see if someone else has experienced the same issues as you. What was their solution? 

### After You Prototype 

* Privately or publicly, consider distributing your core files and documentation via a venue such as GitHub. 
* Take photos or video of prototypes for future reference. 
* Wherever possible, reuse parts for other projects, recycle them, or donate them to a group such as http://www.freegeek.org/. 
* Consider licensing your prototype.
